            p.text-left <h4>A specific challenge faced by inventors under the new &quot;first-to-file&quot; US patent system in place in the US is <u>speed.</u>  Patents can help you assert ownership rights in your idea, but not unless you obtain a patent application filing date earlier than someone else with the same idea.</h4> Founders must act quickly to generate and file a patent application to obtain priority and patent pending status. If a startup founder does not win the race to file a patent application, that innovator may lose the rights in the invention he wishes to build a business around.  Thus, startup founders must protect their innovations before disclosing them to the world.

IdeaJam allows people with special aptitudes market their skills to inventors who require specific aptitudes to solve imperfections associated with their inventions.
            h3 Fund Your Ideas
            p.text-left IdeaJam incorporates a rewards-based crowdfunding platform seamlessly.  Once you create a groundbreaking idea and obtain patent pending status with the help of IdeaJam, you not only can improve the idea with the help of crowdsourced solutions, you can fund the idea through pre-sales and other reward offerings that you generate on IdeaJam's crowdfunding platform.  IdeaJam's members - "imagineers" - can even identify their own aptitudes and offer their services for hire by other imagineers to generate revenue (perhaps to fund more ideas?).  Never before has it been easier to access the intellectual capital and financial capital necessary to build or expand a business around your ideas.
